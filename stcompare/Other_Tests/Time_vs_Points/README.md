Run each model with and without parallelisation on 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 10000 points simulated from the map raster to produce plots of time vs #points. 

Please first run Data_Inputs/make_grid.R, Data_Inputs/load_maps.R, and R/Simulate_points.R to obtain/generate all the required input data. Each model can be run from the command line via the <model>_individual.R scripts with a single command line argument specifying the input dataset to use.
